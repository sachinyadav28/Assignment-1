a.) 
Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

b.)
The Python standard library provides a module called random that offers a suite of functions for generating random numbers.

c.)
The floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.

d.)
Iterator --
*Python iterator objects are required to support two methods while following the iterator protocol.
*__iter__ returns the iterator object itself. This is used in for and in statements.
*__next__ method returns the next value from the iterator. If there is no more items to return then it should raise StopIteration exception.

Generators --
*We create a simple generator using the yield statements. We can use it in a for loop just like we use any other iterators.
*We mostly use generators for laze evaluations. This way generators become a good approach to work with lots of data. If you donâ€™t want to load all the data in the memory, you can use a generator which will pass you each piece of data at a time.

Decorators --
*Decorator is way to dynamically add some new behavior to some objects. We achieve the same in Python by using closures.

e.)
*Syntax difference (List [], Tuple ())
*List are Mutable and Tuple are Immutable
*List can be copied and Tuple can't be copied.
*Tuples are faster than lists when they have larger number of elements.
